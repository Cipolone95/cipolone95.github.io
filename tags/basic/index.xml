I recent passed the ARTE (AWS Red Team Expert) certification and I wanted to write a short blurb on the course, the exam, and the entire experience.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background:&lt;/strong> I am a pentester and have done cloud reviews before so some topics were a review for me.

This is my little corner of the internet where I post about things. I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at keeping this updated, but I do cool things sometimes and I like to talk about them in case other people find them cool. I hope you find something cool here. If not, check back again later. Thanks!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
