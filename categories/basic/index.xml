&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had the opportunity for growth and development. That is, I get a week to be non-billable and get paid to learn and build tools. An absolute dream. And this particular GDT, I had the opportunity to code! I wrote some code to scan code repositories with trufflehog. The issue arose during a pentest, where I found a Github account with several dozen public code repositories. I wanted to check those repositories, but I didnt want to download each one and run trufflehog against it. So I wrote a script to download each repo in the account and run trufflehog against it. Work smarter, not harder. This repo currently supports Github and Docker. Gitlab support has been included, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t added it yet. It will be added shortly and I will probably try to combine everything into one script since there is so much code usage. The repo can be found at &lt;a href="https://github.com/Cipolone95/RepoMole" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://github.com/Cipolone95/RepoMole&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cackalacky Con</title><link>https://cipolone95.github.io/posts/cybersecurity/cackalacky-con/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 08:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cipolone95.github.io/posts/cybersecurity/cackalacky-con/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, I had the opportunity to speak at Cackalacky Con in NC about phishing! It was the perfect opportunity to see some friends and practice my public speaking! This little blog post is about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Talk:&lt;/strong&gt; The talk was a 25 minute lightening talk with two LIVE demos! For context, I run most of the phishing engagements at my place of employment so I&amp;rsquo;ve seen/learned/discovered some things and I wanted to share them with the community. The hardest part was keeping the talk to 25 minutes! Due to the essence of time, I focused on&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ARTE (AWS Red Team Expert) Review</title><link>https://cipolone95.github.io/posts/cybersecurity/arte/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://cipolone95.github.io/posts/cybersecurity/arte/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone!
I recent passed the ARTE (AWS Red Team Expert) certification and I wanted to write a short blurb on the course, the exam, and the entire experience. As with most things I say, these thoughts are my own and donâ€™t necessarily reflect those of my employer, HackTricks, my religion, or anybody/anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; I am a pentester and have done cloud reviews before so some topics were a review for me. Additionally, I have the pentester mindset so I came into the course with the ability to enumerate well, think critically, and know when I am going down a rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://cipolone95.github.io/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://cipolone95.github.io/posts/introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy! This is my little corner of the internet where I post about things. I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at keeping this updated, but I do cool things sometimes and I like to talk about them in case other people find them cool. I hope you find something cool here. If not, check back again later. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rich Content</title><link>https://cipolone95.github.io/posts/category/sub-category/rich-content/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://cipolone95.github.io/posts/category/sub-category/rich-content/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This sample post tests the followings:&lt;/p&gt;
